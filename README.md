# HFFlib
A c# library of functions used by Happyfrozenfire in projects

## How to Use
If you want to use this in your project, simply add HFFlib.dll (found at https://github.com/Happyfrozenfire/hfflib/blob/main/HFFlib/bin/Debug/net5.0/HFFlib.dll) as a dependency. Do note that Program.cs should be ignored entirely.
If you want to test this as a program, simply run HFFlib.exe (found at https://github.com/Happyfrozenfire/hfflib/blob/main/HFFlib/bin/Debug/net5.0/HFFlib.exe). Alternatively, compile and run Program.cs.

## Dependencies
HFFlib, as a library, has no dependencies. However, Program.cs uses the Raylib C# binding as a dependency. You can find Raylib here: https://www.raylib.com
